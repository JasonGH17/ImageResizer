# Image Resizer

Resizes any image to 1920x1080

## How to use

After you install the dependencies and copied your images over to the images folder, you can run: 
```
npm start
```
This will resize all the images and place the resized copies into the ```out``` folder.

If you want the script to be silent run: 
```
npm run start:silent
```
Same results without the script logging anything to the console.

Enjoy!
